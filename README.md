This is a library written in VimL.

elhiv stands for extreme language hacking in VimL. Extreme language hacking is my programming style, but this is actually just a VimL library used by my [vim-project-tags](https://github.com/still-dreaming-1/vim-project-tags) plugin.

**Installation**

Install it the normal way you install Vim plugins, nothing special.
