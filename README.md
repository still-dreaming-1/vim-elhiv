This is a library written in VimL.

elhiv stands for extreme language hacking in VimL. Extreme language hacking is my programming style, but this is actually just a VimL library used by my [vim-project-tags](https://github.com/still-dreaming-1/vim-project-tags) plugin.

**Installation**

First install it the normal way using your favorite plugin manager. Then, from your config file, source elhiv.vim. This line will work inside most
Neovim config files:

`source $HOME/.config/nvim/plugged/vim-elhiv/elhiv.vim`
